# WSD-Server
Stand-alone server for Word Sense Disambiguation, using dependency features and a language model (LM)

This project contains the open system that was used for experiments on Word Sense Disambiguation:  <br/>
Panchenko A., Ruppert E., Faralli S., Ponzetto S. P., and Biemann C. (2017): Unsupervised Does Not Mean Uninterpretable: The Case for Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACLâ€™2017). Valencia, Spain. Association for Computational Linguistics.

The paper can be accessed here: http://panchenko.me/papers/eacl2017.pdf

It uses a trigram language model and induced semantic models that contain word senses. These datasets can be downloaded from Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/485151

## Preparation

- Download the semantic models and the sense inventories
- Add the inventories to a MySQL database
- Load the semantic models into a DCA memory server
- Start the language model
- Adapt the configuration .xml files in resources, so that they point to the MySQL server database

## Running the server

The main class to run the server is tudarmstadt.lt.wsd.server.ApplicationController.java

When the server is running, you can send requests and receive JSON documents:

``curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -X POST   -d '{"context":"The Java code is not working.", "word":"java", "featureType": "depslm"}' SERVER:PORT/predictWordSense``
